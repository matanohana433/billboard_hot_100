# billboard_hot_100
The Spotify Time Machine is a Python application that generates a personalized Spotify playlist based on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from a specific date in history. Users can input a date, and the app will scrape the Billboard Hot 100 songs for that date, search for those tracks on Spotify, and create a private playlist.
