# ðŸŽµ Spotify Time Machine

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

The **Spotify Time Machine** is a Python application that generates a personalized Spotify playlist based on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from a specific date in history. Users can input a date, and the app will scrape the Billboard Hot 100 songs for that date, search for those tracks on Spotify, and create a private playlist.

## ðŸ›  Features
* **Billboard Hot 100 Scraping:** Fetches the top 100 songs from Billboard for a user-specified date.
* **Spotify Playlist Creation:** Creates a private Spotify playlist using the scraped songs.
* **Seamless Integration:** Automatically adds available tracks to the playlist.
* **Dynamic User Input:** Supports any date in the past to explore musical trends.
